## Hints

  - As with anything, if you get stuck, move on, then go back if you have time.
  - Don't spend all night on it!
  - Use resources online to solve harder ones - there are solutions to these questions that work with what we've learnt today, but other tools exist in SQL that could make the queries 'better' or 'easier'.
