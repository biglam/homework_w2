  from users inner join shows_users
  on users.id = shows_users.user_id
  group by name;

select u.name, count(su.show_id) from users u left join shows_users su on su.user_id = u.id group by u.id; -- best way

15. SELECT all users who are going to a show at 17:15.

  select name from users where id in (select show_id from times where time = '17:15');

  select u.name from users u join shows_users su on u.id = su.user_id join times t on su.show_id = t.show_id = id where t.time = '17:15';

## Hints

  - As with anything, if you get stuck, move on, then go back if you have time.
  - Don't spend all night on it!
  - Use resources online to solve harder ones - there are solutions to these questions that work with what we've learnt today, but other tools exist in SQL that could make the queries 'better' or 'easier'.
